In this post, I am going to elaborate on how I made my own local personalized
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Llama Index and Llama 3.

![Local RAG prompt](/assets/works/personalized-retrieval-augmented-generation-system/prompt.png)

Why would we need RAG? According to [Llama Index](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/concepts/),
RAG helps processing and adding external or personal data in the generation process.
Adding this external data can help the model to generate more relevant and accurate responses.
However, adding this external data to the model requires five stages: **loading**, **indexing**, **storing**, **querying**, and **evaluation**.

In this project, I will be including my resume and job descriptions from a local job board in Taiwan
and see how the RAG system can help generate more relevant responses to the job descriptions.
The job descriptions are in markdown format, and here one example:

```markdown
# AI Engineer

**Company:** ...
**Industry:** IT  
**Position:** AI Engineer
**Job Updated:** about 1 month ago  
**Type:** Full-time  
**Level:** Entry level  
**Experience Required:** 3 years  
**Salary:** $$$ TWD / month  
**Remote Work:** Optional

## Job Description

...

### Responsibilities:

- Research and share new AI-related technologies.
- Prepare and deliver in-house training course materials.
- Guide and execute AI-related projects.

## Requirements

**Mandatory Requirements:**

1. Bachelor's degree or above, any major.
2. Proactive, highly cooperative, with analytical problem-solving and communication skills.
3. Proficient in Python programming.
4. Experience in machine learning/deep learning/statistical analysis.
5. Willingness to travel occasionally to partner companies or institutions.

**Preferred Requirements:**

1. Experience in data visualization.
2. Familiarity with TensorFlow/Keras/Scikit-learn/Pytorch.
3. Familiarity with various data analysis algorithms.
```

My local RAG system is limited only to dealing with
markdown files.

In order to get the local RAG system to work, three components are needed:
**an embedding model**, **a vector index**, and **a retrieval model**.

As for the embedding mode, I am using `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` from Hugging Face
As for the vector index, I am using Llama Index.
As for the retrieval model, I am using Llama 3 from Meta.

In order to get a better retrieval result, splitting the job descriptions into
smaller parts and giving the LLM model contexts are necessary.

These are the contexts given to the LLM model:

```markdown
# Context No. 1

Always answer the question directly and concisely.
If you need more information, ask for clarification.
If you are not sure, look into the files provided.
If you do not know the answer, admit it.

# Context No. 2

You are a HR manager with 20+ years of experience
recruiting top talent for Fortune 500 companies.
You can help me with my job search, resume writing,
and interview preparation.
You are here to help me in refining your resume
and preparing for your next job interview.

# Context No. 3

You are a career coach with 20+ years of
experience helping professionals find their dream job.
```

Note that LLM models process information in chunks.
If the job descriptions are too long, the model may not be able to process them.
If too short, the model may not be able to generate relevant responses.
Thus, I should get a balance between the two.
In this project, I set the chunk size to 1500, and the chunk overlap 100.
