## Introduction

![Image search engine homepage](/assets/works/image-search-engine/thumbnail.png "Image search engine homepage")

In this project, the image search engine is made with FastAPI and PyTorch.
The search engine is capable of extracting image featues with the pre-trained ResNet model and 
retrieving similar images from a dataset of memes.

## How It Works?

Image feature extraction is done by removing the last layer of the pre-trained ResNet model.
Thus, the model outputs a feature vector of $2048 \times 1$ dimensions for each image.

When a user uploads an image, the image is processed and its features are extracted.
The newly uploaded image's features are then compared with the features of the meme images in the database.
