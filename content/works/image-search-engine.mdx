## Introduction

In this project, the image search engine is made with FastAPI and PyTorch.
The search engine is capable of extracting image featues with the pre-trained ResNet model and 
retrieving similar images from a dataset of memes.

## How It Works?

This image search engine relies heavily on the images that I collected over the internet.
However, I did not collect the images that much at the beginning.
Instead, the search engine relies on those images uploaded by the users to improve the search results.
The server only receives image files with types of `image/jpg`, `image/jpeg`, and `image/png`.
Unfortunately, the server does not support other types of image files, e.g. `image/gif` or `image/webp`.

Say that a user is at the homepage and wants to search for an image, they can upload an image file via the input form.
As soon as the uploaded image is received by the server, the server will extract features from the image using the pre-trained ResNet18 model.
Once the features are extracted, the pre-trained model will turn the features into a vector of $512x1$ dimension.

Once we have that vector, we can compare it with the vectors of the images in the dataset using cosine similarity.
