## Introduction

![Image search engine homepage](/assets/works/image-search-engine/thumbnail.png "Image search engine homepage")

In this project, the image search engine is made with FastAPI and PyTorch.
The search engine is capable of extracting image featues with the pre-trained ResNet model and 
retrieving similar images from a dataset of memes.

## How It Works?

ResNet50 without the output layer, which is the last layer, is used to extract image features.
Thus, the output of this modified ResNet50 model is a 2048-dimensional vector.

When a user uploads an image, the image is then preprocessed and a 2048-dimensional vector will be assigned to this image.
The newly uploaded image's features are then compared with the features of the meme images that resides in the database.
