## Introduction

In this project, I made a recommendation system for music based on my personal taste. I used the Spotify API to compile a dataset of songs that I like, dislike, and I never heard of or listen to.
With the dataset, I made a recommendation system using one of the supervised learning algorithms from Scikit Learn.
