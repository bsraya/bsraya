## Introduction

This project is my graduate thesis project. I call it "schedulearn" because it is a system that helps you schedule deep learning models.
The main objective of this project is to help you schedule deep learning models with the least amount of effort.
Thus, users can focus more on develiring quality models, not on worrying about resource management.

In this post I will be explaining how this system works in the simplest way possible.

## Overview

![Schedulearn Architecture](/images/portfolios/schedulearn/schedulearn-architecture.png "Schedulearn Architecture")

In the figure above, you can see that there are three main components: the user interface, the API, and the scheduler.

### API

The API consists of three main components: the API endpoints, the database, and the scheduler.
Those API endpoints are responsible for handling the requests from the user interface, such as creating, updating, and deleting models.
The database is responsible for storing the models' metadata.
The scheduler is the core of the system and is responsible for scheduling the models depending on the resources available in the cluster.
Meaning, the system will tell where each model should be trained at and how much resources each model should use.

There are three scheduling algorithms exist within the system:

1. First-In-First-Out (FIFO)
2. Round-Robin (RR)
3. Elastic First-In-First-Out (EFIFO)
