## Introduction

This project is my graduate thesis project. I call it "schedulearn" because it is a system that helps you schedule deep learning models.
The main objective of this project is to help you schedule deep learning models with the least amount of effort.
Thus, users can focus more on develiring quality models, not on worrying about resource management.

In this post I will be explaining how I came up with the implementation, and how I implemented it in Python.
I am sure some of you might not have or have limited background in software engineering, but I will simplify things as much as I can.

## Tech Stacks

### Frontend

2. [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/)
3. [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
4. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
5. [Docker](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
7. [Horovod](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Implementation

In the figure above, I present a rather simple design of the system in which the 
API help you to schedule deep learning models. 

### User Interface 

Clearly, users will intract mostly with a dedicated user interface for Schedulearn. In the user interface, users can
just write down what the model should be called and the number of GPUs they want to use.

For the user interface, I decided to use Next and ChakraUI since those are the two tools that I am familiar the most.
Besides that, those two tools really sped up and simplified the development process. 

### API

Schedulearn's API consists of several end points such as the following.

#### Endpoints

1. `POST` endpoint where they can send their model to be trained.
2. `GET` endpoint where they can check the status of one or multiple models.
3. `DELETE` endpoint where they can delete one or multiple models.

#### Scheduler

The scheduler is the core of the system. It is responsible for scheduling the models. 
Meaning, the system will tell where each model should go and how much resources each model should use.

##### Scheduling Mechanism

This mechanism will tell which models should go. For example, there is a Tensorflow model that requires 2 GPUs.
Meanwhile, there are only two servers, one with 1 GPU and another with 2 GPUs.
It's obvious that the Tensorflow model should go to the latter, given the model requires that much resources to run optimally.
