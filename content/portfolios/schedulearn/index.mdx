# Introduction

This project is my graduate thesis project. I call it "schedulearn" because it is a system that helps you schedule deep learning models.
The main objective of this project is to help you schedule deep learning models with the least amount of effort.
Thus, users can focus more  less on the resources and, most importantly, more on develiring quality models and.

In this post I will be explaining how I came up with the implementation, and how I implemented it in Python.
I am sure some of you might not have or have limited background in software engineering, but I will simplify things as much as I can.

# Tech Stacks

## I. Frontend

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
3. [Chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## II. Backend

1. [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
2. [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/)
3. [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)
4. [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
5. [Docker](https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
6. [Celery](https://celery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
7. [Horovod](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

# Implementation

In the figure above, I present a rather simple design of the system in which the 
API help you to schedule deep learning models. 

## I. User Interface 

Clearly, users will intract mostly with a dedicated user interface for Schedulearn. In the user interface, users can
just write down what the model should be called and the number of GPUs they want to use.

For the user interface, I decided to use Next and ChakraUI since those are the two tools that I am familiar the most.
Besides that, those two tools really sped up and simplified the development process.
