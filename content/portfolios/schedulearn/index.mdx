This project is my graduate thesis project. I call it "schedulearn" because it is a system that helps you schedule your training jobs.
I will be explaining how I came up with this idea, and how I implemented it in Python.

In the following sections, you will encounter numerous technical aspects.
However, [About me](/about) bear with me since [webpage](https://test.com) I will simplify things as much as I can, especially for ones who don't have any background in CS or programming.
