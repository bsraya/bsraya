There are many static site generators, such as [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
However, after a thorough research, I chose [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) since I wanted to get a better understanding in using [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Not only I had learned some React related skills, I also learned how to reproduce and carefully elaborate the technical issues that I encountered in [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) community on Github.
[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) has a huge community which makes it friendly for beginners. In my spare time, I would help resolve the issues posted in the community.

After developing this website for quite some time, I realize that making a great and readable website requires a good understanding of web design and human behaviour.
Thus, I spent a significant amount of time on how to create a user-friendly website. Here is a list of things I learned:

1. Users love simple, blazing-fast websites
2. Users expect to find relevant information within seconds
3. Color combination and font size could affect reading experience

Have my previous personal website reached the three points mentioned? I think it was far from it.
At least I can regard it as a learning experience.

## Insights

After working on my previous website for so long, I found out that maintaining the codebase was not easy since I wrote some of the stylings from scratch.
Thus the stylings were not very consistent from one page to another, and the design looked very rigid and not that user-friendly.
Besides those, Gatsby's build time was way slower compared to Next's.

Those are the reasons why I spend a month in the summer of 2022 just to rewrite my personal website.
Before developing my new personal website, I decided to use ready-to-use styling frameworks like [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
so I can focus more on developing user-friendly components. [Click here](/portfolio/personal-website-v2) to see how I made it.
