# Introduction

I chose Next.js to be the framework for my website because it is the most popular framework for React.
The next reason of choosing Next.js is that it has a way shorter built time. Unlike Gatsbyjs, it takes 1 to 5 minutes for any changes to takes effect depending on the size of the website.
Let's say we have 20 blog pages, then the build time will be about 10 minutes or even more. 
With Next.js, it will be only 1 or 2 minutes.

# Chakra UI

I also chose ChakraUI because it is the most popular UI library for React. I also chose MDX because it is the most popular framework for Markdown. I also chose Firebase because it is the most popular backend framework for React. I also chose Vercel because it is similar to Gatsby.js which is built on top of React.
