5. Firebase
6. Vercel

# Introduction

I chose Next.js to be the framework for my website because it is the most popular framework for React.
The next reason of choosing Next.js is that it has a way shorter built time. Unlike Gatsbyjs, it takes 1 to 5 minutes for any changes to takes effect depending on the size of the website.
Let's say we have 20 blog pages, then the build time will be about 10 minutes or even more.
With Next.js, it will be only 1 or 2 minutes.

# Chakra UI

I also chose ChakraUI because it is ready to use out of the box. Unlike TailWindCSS or Theme UI, it does not require that much configuration.
The only thing that I need is to install and wrap the `<ChakraProvider>` component around all Next.js components.

Moreover, customizing the theme is easy. First, I have to create a file called `theme.tsx`, under `./styles` in the main directory of the project.

```typescript:theme.tsx
import { extendTheme } from "@chakra-ui/react";

const Theme = extendTheme({
    fonts: {
        body: "Inter, sans-serif",
    },
});

export default Theme;
```

Once the customized theme has been created, the theme should be included in `_app.tsx` file.

```typescript:_app.tsx {3,7}
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
import { Theme } from '../styles/theme'
import { ChakraProvider } from '@chakra-ui/react'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
    return (
        <ChakraProvider theme={Theme}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </ChakraProvider>
    )
}

export default MyApp
```

Simply put, the usage of ChakraUI is pretty straight forward. Thus, it became the choice of my framework.

# MDX

The reason I chose MDX is it allows me incorporate mathematical equations in my website.
Some of my posts, for example the posts in the [Gradient Descent: An Optimization Algorithm](/blog/gradient-descent) series, requires alot of maths to explain.

# Firebase

Since I want to keep track the engagement of each post, I chose Firebase as the database.
With Firebase, I can store the number of views of each post.

# Vercel

Lastly, I chose Vercel as the hosting platform because it is the most popular hosting platform for Next.js, and it is free for hobby projects.
