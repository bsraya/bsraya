In this post of this series, I will be collecting those songs that I liked and saved in my playlists.

Since I am already subscribed to Spotify, I can use their API to get songs' metadata.
Unfortunately, I did not know there was a framework called [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/) that can be used to interact with Spotify API.
Since I have had my half of my foot in the door, I decided to use my own functions to interact with Spotify API and save the metadata in parquet files.
