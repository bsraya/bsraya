## Introduction

I am going to seperate this post into two parts: the technical part and the insight part.
The technical part consists of how I prepared, passed, and predicted the data.
While the insight part consists of the result of the prediction and what the prediction tells me.

## Music Features / Aspects

The dataset consists of my favorite songs from my own playlists, and each column represents different aspects of the song.

Each aspect represents:
1. __popularity__
2. __acousticness__
3. __danceability__
4. __duration_ms__
5. __energy__
6. __instrumentalness__
7. __key__
8. __liveliness__
9. __mode__
10. __speechiness__
11. __tempo__
12. __time_signature__
13. __valence__

For more details what each aspect entails, you can check out [Spotify's documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/).
