If you have not installed Conda, you can download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

Make sure not to install Keras and PyTorch in the same environment.
This is because they have different dependencies and versions that might conflict with each other.

## Keras

First, create a Conda Environment.

```bash
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.9
conda activate tensorflow
```

Then, install `cudnn` and `cuda`.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2.2 cudnn=8.1.0
```

Finally, install Keras by installing Tensorflow.
Make sure to specify which versions to install. Otherwise, you would
notice any kind of incompatility issues.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --user tensorflow==2.5.0 matplotlib==3.6 scipy==1.10
```

Check if the GPU is detected by TensorFlow.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))
```

## PyTorch

Create a new Conda Environment for PyTorch.

```bash
conda create -n pytorch python=3.10
conda activate pytorch
```

Install necessary packages for PyTorch.

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

Check if the GPU is detected by PyTorch.

```python
import torch
print(torch.cuda.is_available())
```
