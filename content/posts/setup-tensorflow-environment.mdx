First, create a Conda Environment.

```bash
conda create -n tensorflow python=3.9
conda activate tensorflow
```

Then, install `cudnn` and `cuda`.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2.2 cudnn=8.1.0
```

Finally, install `tensorflow`.

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --user tensorflow==2.5.0 matplotlib==3.6 scipy==1.10
```

Make sure to specify which versions to install. Otherwise, you would
notice any kind of incompatility issues.
